Collation
A collation is a special pragma (for more info, see Pragmas) that allows users to specify a culture and string compare options for a datafile.

Collation is a read-only pragma and can only be changed with a rebuild.

A collation is specified with the format CultureName/CompareOption1[,CompareOptionN]. For more info about compare options, check the .NET documentation.

Datafiles are always created with CultureInfo.CurrentCulture as their culture and with IgnoreCase as the compare option. The collation can be change by rebuilding the datafile.

Internally, the culture info is stored in the header of the datafile using its LCID value. Cultures with LCID value 4096 are not supported. When an unsupported culture is detected, the rebuild defaults to CultureInfo.InvariantCulture.

Examples
rebuild {"collation": "en-US/None"}; rebuilds the datafile with the en-US culture and regular string comparison

rebuild {"collation": "en-GB/IgnoreCase"}; rebuilds the datafile with the en-GB culture and case-insensitive string comparison

rebuild {"collation": "pt-BR/IgnoreCase,IgnoreSymbols"}; rebuilds the datafile with the pt-BR culture and case-insensitive string comparison that also ignores symbols (white spaces, punctuation, math symbols etc.)
